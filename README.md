# Project: Medical Clinic Appointment System

## Project Statement

**Problem:** 
Patients face difficulties booking appointments via phone, leading to scheduling conflicts and long waiting times. Clinics struggle to manage patient records efficiently, resulting in poor time management and patient dissatisfaction. The current manual system is prone to human error, lacks automation, and provides a poor experience for both patients and clinic staff.

**Challenges & Inefficiencies:**
- Inefficient, manual appointment scheduling.
- High chance of scheduling conflicts and double bookings.
- Difficulty in accessing and managing patient records.
- Lack of a centralized system for doctors to manage their schedules.
- No automated reminders for appointments, leading to no-shows.
- Time-consuming administrative tasks for clinic staff.
